      <h2>About the Special Olympics</h2>
      <p>
        The Special Olympics is an international sports organization dedicated
        to empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities through
        year-round sports training and athletic competition. Founded in 1968,
        the organization serves millions of athletes worldwide by offering
        Olympic-style sports opportunities designed to promote physical
        fitness, confidence, and personal growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond competition, the Special Olympics fosters leadership, teamwork,
        and social inclusion. Athletes are encouraged to develop lifelong
        skills, build meaningful relationships, and participate actively in
        their communities. The organization also works to change public
        perceptions by advocating for equality, respect, and acceptance for
        individuals with intellectual disabilities in all areas of society.

    <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The Special Olympics plays a vital role in promoting inclusion,
        confidence, and equal opportunity for individuals with intellectual
        disabilities. Participation in sports helps athletes improve physical
        health, develop discipline, and gain confidence while forming
        friendships that extend far beyond the playing field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact of the Special Olympics reaches families, schools, and
        communities by fostering understanding and acceptance. By celebrating
        abilities rather than focusing on limitations, the program helps build
        stronger, more compassionate communities throughout Nevada and around
        the world.

    <!-- LAS VEGAS HOSTING -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Why Las Vegas Should Host the Special Olympics</h2>
      <p>
        Hosting the Special Olympics in Las Vegas would provide significant
        social, cultural, and economic benefits to both the city and the state
        of Nevada. With its world-class venues, hospitality infrastructure, and
        global visibility, Las Vegas is uniquely positioned to welcome athletes,
        families, volunteers, and spectators from across the nation and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to boosting tourism and local business activity, hosting
        the event would highlight Nevada’s commitment to inclusion,
        accessibility, and community engagement. The Special Olympics would
        generate positive media attention, inspire civic pride, and leave a
        lasting legacy of awareness and support for individuals with
        intellectual disabilities.
